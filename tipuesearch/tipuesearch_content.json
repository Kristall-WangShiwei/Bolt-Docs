On UDOO Bolt you can run all the software available for the PC world, from gaming to video streaming, from graphical editors to professional development platforms, plus all the software for the Arduino\u2122 Leonardo world, including all the sketches, libraries and the official Arduino\u2122 IDE. UDOO Bolt embeds two processors: the new AMD Ryzen\u2122 Embedded V1000, V1605B or 1202B, 14nm, up to a 4-cores\/8-threads CPU, with a thermal design power of just 12-25W, designed for really fast Ultrathin Notebooks. This processor family brings together the breakthrough performance of the pioneering AMD \u201cZen\u201d CPU and AMD \u201cVega\u201d GPU architectures in a seamlessly-integrated SoC solution that sets a new standard in processing power for next-generation embedded designs. the Atmel\u00ae ATmega32U4 8-bit AVR microcontroller, the same of Arduino\u2122 Leonardo. While the AMD Ryzen\u2122 Embedded V1000 processor can run all the Windows 10 and Linux 64bit Distros you want to use as desktop PC, the Atmel\u00ae ATmega32U4 allows easy access to a Arduino\u2122 Leonardo environment. Download the User Manual to have more complete explanation of the UDOO BOLT hardware and features. Heads up! In order to prevent damages to your board, remember to: CE and FCC certifications retained using only the UDOO BOLT qualified Power Supply. When not using UDOO Bolt qualified Power Supply, use 19VDC (min 60W power) PSUs certified for your country (make sure that the power cable is less than 3 mt. long). CE and FCC certifications retained with the board inside the UDOO BOLT metal case. When not available, we suggest using a case with the same attributes as the UDOO BOLT metal Case. This product should be operated in a well-ventilated environment and, if used inside a case, the case should not be covered. This product should be elevated on a stable, flat, electrically non-conductive surface whilst in operation, and clear from any object that can induce a short-circuit. Do not expose it to water, moisture or heat from any source; UDOO BOLT is designed for reliable operation at normal ambient room temperatures. Avoid handling the warm and moving parts (like the fan) and generally the printed circuit board while it is powered. Only handle by the edges to minimise the risk of electrostatic discharge damage. Take care whilst handling to avoid mechanical or electrical damage to the printed circuit board and connectors. Also use a grounded wrist strap or touch a safely grounded object before you handle components. Never provide more than 5V in input to the GPIOs of the Arduino Leonardo(Atmel\u00ae ATmega32U4), and never provide more than 3.3V in input to the GPIOs of the Embedded Controller. Do not use a NON-standard USB 3.0 peripheral. If you use a non-standard USB 3.0 peripheral with an external power plug, this could send back the power source to the UDOO Bolt board with the risk of damage. The most important safety rule of all: Always Be Careful! (ABC) Lineup UDOO Bolt retail line up consists of two models.

Thanks to the x86_64 instruction set, the UDOO BOLT supports all the x86 Linux distribution for 32-bit(aka i386, IA-32, x86-32, x86_32) and 64-bit(aka x64, x86-64, x86_64). We suggest to always use a 64-bit OS version. Heads up! Please notice that usually you need a 64-bit OS version to exploit more than 4GB of RAM. Total amount of memory available with a 32-bit OS depends on the OS itself (usually less than 4GB unless the OS isn't using PAE). In the Getting Started section you can find a guide of how to install a Linux distro, the example is based on the Ubuntu OS. In order to download the latest stable updated versions of the AMD Ryzen\u2122 drivers for the v1000 Embedded Series processors you can visit this page: V-Series V1000 Drivers &amp; Support | AMD . The OS supported by these drivers in the Linux x86_64 version is Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS. In the package you can find a User Manual with instructions to know how to install the drivers. You can use also the standard open source drivers contained in the Linux Kernel but some of the graphical features (Libdrm, Mesa, Ddx, Gstomx, LLVM, Vulkan, ROCm) may not work as expected. Heads up! The AMD processors of the UDOO BOLT and the Wi-Fi\/BT module are released only few time ago so we suggest to use a recent distribution to find all the latest drivers already installed and all working properly. Famous Linux distributions Here you can find an unordered list of 10 of the most popular Linux distributions: Ubuntu: is probably the most well-known Linux distribution. Ubuntu is based on Debian, but it has its own software repositories. Much of the software in these repositories is synced from Debian\u2019s repositories. Ubuntu 18.10 Cosmic Cuttlefish is the latest Ubuntu released version. Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Bionic Beaver is the latest Long Term Support version with a support end of life on April 2023. In the V-Series V1000 Drivers &amp; Support | AMD page you can find AMD stable drivers to support Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS. Linux Mint is a Linux distribution built on top of Ubuntu. It uses Ubuntu\u2019s software repositories, so the same packages are available on both. Originally, Mint was an alternative distribution loved mainly because it included media codecs and proprietary software that Ubuntu didn\u2019t include by default. Debian is an operating system composed only of free, open-source software. The Debian project has been operating since 1993 \u2014 over 20 years ago! This widely respected project is still releasing new versions of Debian, but it\u2019s known for moving much more slowly than distributions like Ubuntu or Linux Mint. This can make it more stable and conservative, which is ideal for some systems. Arch Linux is more old school than many of the other Linux distributions here. It\u2019s designed to be flexible, lightweight, minimal, and to \u201cKeep it Simple.\u201d Keeping it simple doesn\u2019t mean Arch provides tons of graphical utilities and automatic configuration scripts to help you set up your system. Instead, it means Arch dispenses with that stuff and gets out of your way. Fedora is a project with a strong focus on free software \u2014 you won\u2019t find an easy way to install proprietary graphics drivers here, although third-party repositories are available. Fedora is bleeding edge and contains the latest versions of software. CentOS \/ Red Hat Enterprise Linux Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a commercial Linux distribution intended for servers and workstations. It\u2019s based on the open-source Fedora project, but is designed to be a stable platform with long-term support. CentOS and Red Hat recently announced they\u2019re collaborating, so CentOS is now part of Red Hat itself. openSUSE \/ SUSE Linux Enterprise openSUSE is a community-created Linux distribution sponsored by Novell. Novell purchased SuSE Linux in 2003, and they still create an enterprise Linux project known as SUSE Linux Enterprise. Where Red Hat has the Fedora project that feeds into Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Novell has the openSUSE project that feeds into SUSE Linux Enterprise. Mageia \/ Mandriva Mageia is a fork of Mandriva Linux created in 2011. Mandriva \u2014 known as Mandrake before that \u2014 was once one of the great user-friendly Linux distributions. Slackware Linux is another institution. Founded in 1993, Slackware is the oldest Linux distribution that\u2019s still maintained and putting out new releases today. Puppy Linux is another fairly well-known Linux distribution. Previous versions have been built on Ubuntu, but the latest is built on Slackware. Puppy is designed to be a small, lightweight operating system that can run well on very old computers. Others useful distributions: LibreELEC \u2013 Just enough OS for KODI Kodi is a free and open-source media player software application developed by the XBMC Foundation. LibreELEC (short for Libre Embedded Linux Entertainment Center) is a distro based on Kodi, is a non-profit fork of OpenELEC as an open source just enough OS (JeOS) Linux software appliance distro for Kodi. Lakka is a lightweight Linux distribution that transforms a computer into a full blown game console for retrogaming. source www.howtogeek.com To help choosing your favorite distro you can also check this linux.org article.
